# Nonobtuse-Triangulation
Nonobtuse Triangulation of Polygons and PSLGs
This project consists of an implementation for nonobtuse triangulation of polygons and PSLGs largely based on [Bern et al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/177424.177974).

The implementation can be tested by running either the main_polygon.py or main_pslg.py for drawing instances of polygons and pslgs respectively.

We also provide some existing instances for testing purposes in src/polygons and src/pslgs. Details for how to run them can be found in the respective main files.
